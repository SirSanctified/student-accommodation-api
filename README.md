# student-accommodation

Many university students who are not living on campus have trouble finding accommodation. In some cities there are 'boarding houses' where students live. This project is dedicated to help students find the boarding houses that suit their needs.

## Features

- **Search Houses By City**

Students, registered or unregistered, can search for houses in the city they wish to stay.

- **Book For A Room**

Registered students can book for a room, and an email address will be automatically sent to the landlord.

- **Review Houses**

Registered students can review houses they live in or they once lived in. This helps other students make informed decisions, as some landlords lie over the phone.

- **Registration**

Landlords can register to be able to add their houses to the listings. Students can also register to be able to book rooms and review houses.
